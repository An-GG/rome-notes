- asyrians
    - in mesopotamia  
    - in modern day iraq
    - they created aquaducts
        - king responsible: Sennachorito?

- etruscans
    - occupied central and norther italy
    - prior to the rise of rome
    - romans existed alongside, they the wiped out romans

**very little etruscan culture survived into the roman period**
- some things survived, like water infrastructure

- water are the main types of water sources
    - catchment: basin (all the surrounding land features) that drains into a river or a lake
    - dam
        -  sluece / sluice ? - splillway on either side of the dam: channeled to pathways
    - cisterns : water tank to collect rainwater or buffer water 
    - well: what happens when you drill over an aquefer
    - spring: artisian spring is made naturally at point of highest pressure
    - lakes were used as well
- what are standard ways to collect or capture water
- how do you (a roman) determine that water is safe to drink
    - rivers and lakes have biological life which contaminate the water
    - springs and aquaefers do not have much life
    - the way you know is by using prexisting knowledge
        - if ppl have been drinking it, its prob fine
- how would you purify water
- ancient agricultural sites are littered with human trash
    - we know where the fields were bc they have animal manure all over it
        - how do the output of the latrines get to agriculture fields? 
    - people shoved trash down the toilet

    - **9/12** so here's how the trash and toilet waste gets to the farmland
        - they didn't have really flushing toilets they disposed of their waste in `cesspits`
        - there would be the 'shitman' (prob offensive) he would come get your stuff and put it in his cart, and then go and sell this to farmers 




**collecting water**
- for any type of water container, you want to collect water from the top the body
    - allows gunk and sediment to settle
    - if you capture from river, you first let it settle in a pool and then scoop from top

- the only real way the romans could purify water was to let it settle

- nileometer

- alluvium 
```
def: a deposit of clay, silt, sand, and gravel left by
flowing streams in a river valley or delta,
typically producing fertile soil.
```

hydrology: natural water systems

medditerranian diet:
    - olives - selected for their resiliancy 
    - wheat
    - wine
    - and fish as primary meat 

--- 

- masada, isreal
    - very dry part of roman empire
    - actually no aquefers, they must have used very elaborate cisterns

## DEF: aqueduct 
    - a channel that carries water from a river to somewhere else

- aqueducts needed arches for coverings
    - true vs false arch
        - false arch uses staggered blocks 
        - early roman empire


# 8/29

- Water has been sacred forever
    - sacrament
    - christianity baptism
- all religions


- most of the subsurface rock was not limestone, it was volcanic rock
    - the water does not get hard

- springs will only sometimes burst from directly underneath, usually emerge from random hill or the side 
     - inside aqueduct

**SpringHouses** 
    - built in Estrucan region in tuff
        - tuff: soft volcanic stone
        - its soft but sturdy, you can cut continuous channels through the stone 
    - connected to aqueducts, you could have lavish underground springs 

Etruscan Coniculus 
    - probably just for spreading water out to everyone, unlike springhouse
    - used for like latrines

Samos tunnel
    - 1 km tunnel without guide holes at the top, accurately figured out direction to dig from both ends
    - they can track their movement across a level plane very well, but measuring altitude changes at the same time is hard
        - follow contour of mountain around mountain, which you can track very well and then use pythagorean theorem

# 8/31

- pythagorous was alive and samos was his hometown

For water projects, they had vast pipe systems
- terracotta (clay) pipes with flanges and holes for servicing
- greek cities had pipes to one place (springhouse)
- roman cities distributed water around

Water Divinity
- clitumnus spring
- one place with many gods

Sicily
- in antiquity sicility was very good for agriculture (today eroded)
- regardless, it is relatively dry area of land that gets water sparsely, (maybe alot all at once)
    - so it was greatly valued
- syracuse sicily - grotta del ninfeo
    - cave, very important and worshiped
    - caves are a motif for water and generousity 

- apotropaic: a sort of symbol that is thought to protect spaces
    - lion heads placed in front of nymphaeum (central water fountain)
    - on corners of buildings (vulnerable places)

# 9/7

**Acheloos**
- bearded man with horns, often as head of an animal
    - this dude is everywhere
- he fights hercueles, looses and hercueles breaks of his horn
    - horn becomes cornocopia (horn of plenty)
- the animal is often seen as a sacrifice
    - romans believed animal went willingly to sacrifice, they made it nod its head (or kneel)
        - might be whats on some coins

- rivers are often represented as reclinging male figure

- Pan (half man half goat) like Saytr
    - origin of horny (the devil)

- Nimes, France (Spring of Namausus) 
    - the greeks did colonize southern france
- Zaghoun in north africa also had spring also colonized 

- bath, england (there's a ancient roman resort there)
    - its centered on a thermal spring
    - the romans wrote curses on lead tablets (sheets of lead that could be rolled up)
    - they threw them into the water because the underground water would go down to the underworld where the gods are
    - the underworld was not negative or positive (unlike hell)

# 9/9

**Atrium House**
- cistern was in atrium (called impluvium)
- water collected through hole in roof
- water also collected from garden

Safety of cistern
--
- cistern allows sediment and dirt to settle to bottom
    - but it was second teir emergency water
    - they didn't know about microbes
    - they used it primarily for bathing

- it seems that the aqueduct at pompeii was out of use at time of eruption
    - which is confusing, it seems they were using cisterns more

- it was understood, at least by some intellectuals that water comes and goes in cycles, 
    - but generally bad luck was associated as punishment from gods

dams
--
- dams are never completely stopping a river, they allow much of the water to flow
- dams were built near features that allowed easy diversion
- concrete is a roman era invention
    - concrete does not 'dry', the water converts by use of a chemical reaction
    - called hydration
- we don't really known how any of the dams were built we can only speculate


- roman dams have towers as well (intake / outlet tower)
    - rivers cary sediment which settles
    - settling sediment will raise the floor of the dam which is bad
    - the towers allow water in in front of the dam and have a tunnel below the dam and that water gets used
    - the towers fix this idk exactly how

- check dam (unlike previous, this dam is used specifically to collect sediment)
- they collect lots of topsoil, the channels of the dam are cultivated for agriculture use

weir
--
- weirs are like dams but instead of stopping the water, they just slow it down 

# 9/12

**Taxes**
- the aquaeducts were gifts to the people, they were not projects undertaken for the benefit of the people
    - some rich people decided to do the projects and they were considered gifts
    - still, everyone benefited from their availability, (absolutely everyone went to the baths)

# 9/14

- siphons are complicated and required significant engineering skill
    - get water through a valley
- another thing that is complicated: getting water from really high to low place quickly
    - solution: cascades, use series of direct tunnels going down, then going straight, down, straight, ..
    - slows water down

- there were bridges and arcade bridges
    - arcade bridges were near city, but they also needed to build 'real bridges' from time to time

- they had many settling tanks, water flows like up and down in tunnels to settle sediment
    - sleucegate is a sliding door for blocking water

- valleys are valleys because they degrade more quickly than harder rock

- usually major erosion events happen instantly
    - romans, if they made the decision to do so, would go hard and make things to last
    - arguabley might have had a 100 year out attention span

- aqua traiana `this was something prof contributed to analyzing and official paper`

- trajan emperor idk why relevant
    - emperors wanted to introduce aquaeducts to a city
    - ok relevant bc he built an enormous bath complex near center of city
    - built alot of stuff to flex water


## bruh staged naval battles literal hunger games

- he made a central basically entertainment complex to host naval battles between prisoners and other 'degens' 
    - they were fighting for their freedom
    - this would only happen once every few generations
    -
- 'shadoof' idk how spell but its a middle eastern device to lift and lower water bucket
 - tree as pivot point


# 9/16

- asclypius 
- goddess hygieia of health

- sigilano vicarello are 2 diff cities apart of a pilgrimage circuit
- many like significant sacred artifacts to visit during cir
    - somewhat unusual during this time period
- as we know aquaeducts often cross valleys, pont du gard is unusually built across river but bc they absolutely had to due to geography 
    - very unusual construction, no concrete only gravity, and the blocks were not interlaced staggered, vertically stacked
    - blocks were labeled L1, M4, D2, etc
    - for levo, media, dextro (left mid right)
        - numbered and labeled bc you could make them independently. without perfection acrross all
- why were aquaeducts not really used for transport 
    - aquaeducts fundamentally get resource from place where noone is to someone where ppl are
    - those routes were not really that useful
    - they did have a service clearnace, it was used, not really a major highway

# 9/21

Technological Instrumentation
- Antikythera mechanism was made during greek era (prior to greek conquering, so during 'hellenistic era')
- surveying devices of hero of alexandria
    - dioptra: angle measuring sight
        - 360 divisions per rotation was ancient invention
        - meridians and parallels as well
    - water leveling sight
- one of the librarians alexrandia calculated the circumference of the earth within 1000 miles of accuracy
- surveying devices
    - roman folding field rod (like a meterstick, could be folded in half)
    - vitruvius hodometer: origin of odometer
        - hypoid gear: angled gear profile at 90 deg (angled, why? maybe for accuracy)
    - dioptra: they didn't know the distance, they only knew relative angles from measurements
    - groma / gromatici / agrimensores : used 90 degree angle things to establish grids on agricultural lands
- language is suggestive of using 'maps' for aqueducts
    - we don't know if the maps were schematical, or if they were positionally and accurate to shape
        - prob schematical, bc its not useful to be accureate 
    - they had capability for positional accuracy tho we know from farm maps
    -
# 9/23

- hodge says "The presumption thus is not only that on this aqueduct the construction was divided up into separate contracts (which, on so large a project, would in any case be no more than a reasonable assumption),"

# 9/26

-  surveying devices:
    - They could actually kind of measure angle
    - they can get acurate (relative) positioning useing geometry, without any absolute lenght measurement
    - you can go to some other point where you can see target point and vantage point as well
        - both angles allow for high relative accuracy without absolute accuracy

# 9/28

- `rama` stands for branch in roman
    - what are the ramafications 
        - what are the branch effects

- map of aqueduct plan (model, not dimensionally accurate)
    - has branches from main aqueduct saying "some dude's house: two waters, from 2nd to 6th hour"
    - aqueducts branched alot near the city to distribute, the switched water on and off

- roman sundial was inscripted on stone, not usually dial shaped
    - hyperbolic looking diagram with not just lines at various direction for hour, but also has lines that measure shadow length
        - this changes based on geographic location

- marble plan at rome, giant, very positionally acurate map carved in marble
    - incredible precision down to the first floor of every building in the urban center
    - useful for buying and selling property and taxation
        - our best guess for why this map exists: water bill was basicaly property tax
        - water office was measuring square footage of property (frontienus talks about this)

# 9/30

- siphon utilizes water under pressure
- siphon at aspendos had like towers in middle of drop and rise, which brought the water up and down for seemingly no reason
    - it wasn't to decrease pressure, bc the towers rose from lowest point
        - (meaning they would need to be able to to make pipes that can already widthstand max  pressure)
        - maintainence wasn't that big of a deal
        - it was prob to get rid of air bubbles when water suddenly turns on and off, such as with seasonal change
- despite what might be theorized, they could not get water to higher than origin point
    - fluid flow friction is proportional to velocity, you're really fighting nature

- in the literature they just call the top of the header tank 1 atmosphere
    - romans used measurement called a "head" (hight difference), which is accurate for pressure

- lead pipes were the favored material as it could be strongly soldered on site
- there are other examples of towers where they are actually used more for water storage orjst or for maintaining / lowering pressure - pompeii

- most pipes in cities had very steep gradient, they used relieving tank / tower system over large gradients to slow them down

--- 
need good calibration and measurement methods
- they couldn't just predict with math, had to be able to measure
